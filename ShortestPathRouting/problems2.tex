\begin{problem}{1}
Suppose that all link metrics in a graph has the same value. What
characterizes the paths found by a shortest--path algorithm?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
Consider a situation, where packets transmitted on a link will
either arrive without errors at the other end--point of the link,
or be lost. The probability of a packet loss on the link between
nodes $i$ and $j$ is denoted $P_{ij}$. Determine the function for
translating a link's packet loss rate into a metric, so that the
shortest paths are the paths that maximizes the probability that
the packets arrive at the destination, \ie determine $f()$ in the
relation: $C_{ij} = f(P_{ij})$.
\end{problem}
